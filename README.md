## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a strong background in **PHP and Laravel**, leading projects and collaborating with teams to build modern web applications. I enjoy working on both frontend and backend, and I'm deeply committed to writing clean, maintainable code that delivers real value.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Laravel**: My primary backend framework, used for building robust and scalable applications.
- **Blade (Laravel Templating)**: For creating dynamic and reusable frontend components.
- **Livewire**: Adds reactivity to Laravel apps without the complexity of a frontend JavaScript framework.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for crafting responsive and modern UIs.
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight JavaScript framework used alongside Livewire for frontend interactions.
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL**: Used depending on project requirements for managing relational data.
- **Filament** *(when needed)*: For rapid admin panel development and resource management.
